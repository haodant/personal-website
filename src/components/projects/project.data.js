      "To motivate pedestrians to interact with the instant environment instead of looking at their phone, we created an interactive installation using Arduino and laser cutting. The concept is a huge glass wall with several kaleidoscopes on the side of an overpass. When people are passing, the kaleidoscopes will rotate so that people see an amazing view of the outside world. If using phone to light the kaleidoscope, the different layers of the kaleidoscope will start to rotate in different directions.",

    description:
      "Through two experiments, we explore how to design shape-changing interfaces using theories of the relation between biological motion and affect. In the first experiment, participants viewed six shape-changing behaviors that varied the velocity, fluidity, direction, and orientation of the movement of an extrusion from a small box. The second experiment used 36 shape-changing behaviors that systematically varied in speed, regularity of motion, and direction. Speed, direction, and orientation impacted emotion ratings significantly and in the predicted directions. These results offer an initial basis for the systematic design of emotions in shape-changing interfaces. ",

    description:
      "This study investigates whether empathy towards an interactive trash bin, particularly empathy induced by the bin’s anthropomorphic appearance and behavior, affects people’s evaluations of the artifact and their intention to use it to recycle. We performed an online survey in which 344 participants viewed a video showing a person interacting with a recycling bin in one of three conditions. We measured people’s perceptions of the bin’s anthropomorphism and animacy, their empathy towards and enjoyment of the bin, and intentions to use the bin. The results suggest that the level of anthropomorphism attributed to the artifact by participants positively affected their empathy towards the recycling bin, which in turn directly influenced their intentions to use the bin.

However, despite the growing interest in drones for social scenarios, there are only a few drones have paid attention to factors such as drone's movements, appearance, and comfortable distance for natural human-robot interaction (HRI). In this study, we explore the critical factors for successful human-drone interactions (HDI) in a social scenario, and proposed a social friendly design by implementing new appearance and behaviors of a drone.",

Our findings suggest that participants' cultural backgrounds and type and level of religious belief affected their attributions of anthropomorphism to interactive artifacts. Furthermore, participants rated technologies that imitate living forms and can engage in dialogue with users more highly in terms of anthropomorphism. We discuss how these findings can stimulate discussion about and contribute to the design of lifelike technologies. ",

    description: "By interviewing 30 participants from both academia and industry, the paper examines how people write together using today’s commercially available systems. The analysis focuses on the new co-editing capabilities (e.g., track changes) that are integrated into commercial tools and thus adopted by users widely in the last decade. We systematically analyze users’ rationales of why they do not want to write together while they are writing together with other. We argue that the development of collaborative writing tools is far from finished and these findings provide insights into the design of technology and suggest future directions for research.  ",
